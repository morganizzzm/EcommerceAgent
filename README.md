### 📊 Evaluation Report

## Performance Metrics
> * *Accuracy*: In the context of this project, accuracy measures how often the chatbot's predicted response matches the expected response from a predefined set of queries and responses.
- Evaluation Method: The chatbot's accuracy is calculated by using a test set of dialogues. Each response generated by the chatbot is compared to the expected response, and the proportion of correct responses over the total number of responses is computed.
- Data Source: The predefined dialogues used for accuracy evaluation are stored in model/data.py. These dialogues include a variety of typical customer inquiries, such as questions about order status, return policies, and requests for human assistance.
- Loss Function: The accuracy is evaluated according to the CrossEntropyLoss function. 
- Calculation: During training and evaluation, the CrossEntropyLoss is calculated for each prediction. The overall accuracy is derived by converting the probability distribution output by the softmax layer of the model into a discrete class prediction and comparing it to the actual class.
- Example Calculation: Suppose the chatbot correctly predicts 85 out of 100 test queries. The accuracy would be calculated as (85/100) * 100 = 85%.
> * *Response Relevance*: Assessed by the relevance of the responses to the input queries.
- Measure by the list of expected outputs. 
> * *User Satisfaction*: Measured based on user feedback collected during interactions.
- After the dialog is over, the user is asked to provide feedback: whether they were satisfied or not by the service. The answer is stored in the txt file user_feedback.txt in the format : User_id, Query, Satisfaied: Yes/No. At each time step one can look at the user_feedback.txt and
